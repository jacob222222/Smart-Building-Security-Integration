# Smart Building Security System Integration (Simulated)

This project simulates a comprehensive smart security system setup for a multi-floor corporate building using Bosch BIS (Building Integration System).  
The goal is to demonstrate programming, commissioning, and integration of IP cameras, access control devices, and alarm systems, using real-world tools and best practices.

---

## Objectives

- Design a secure corporate office layout with surveillance and access control zones.
- Simulate configuration and commissioning of devices using Bosch software.
- Centralize event logging and live monitoring with BIS and BVMS.

---

## Tools Used

- Bosch Building Integration System (BIS)
- Bosch Video Management System (BVMS)
- Bosch Configuration Manager
- AutoCAD, Microsoft Visio, or diagrams.net
- Windows Server VM
- (Optional) SQL Server for event logging

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- IP camera and access control commissioning
- Alarm configuration and event monitoring
- Security zone design and escalation response
- System audit and remediation documentation
- Integration and network topology planning

---

## Project Documentation and Steps

### Phase 1: System Planning and Layout

- Created a floor plan using diagrams.net to define security zones, camera placement, and access control points.
- Designed the network topology for device connectivity and controller integration.

### Phase 2: Software Installation and Simulation Setup

- Installed Bosch Configuration Manager, BIS, and BVMS on a virtual Windows Server.
- Configured simulated devices (cameras and controllers) using configuration files.
- Linked all systems through BVMS for event visualization.

### Phase 3: Programming and Commissioning

- Set up access control zones with badge rules using BIS access configurations.
- Added IP cameras to BVMS and configured motion-based recording triggers.
- Simulated alarm events for door forced entry and unauthorized access.

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Validation

- Used BIS dashboard to monitor live events, generate audit logs, and configure automated alerts.
- Conducted a simulated test of all zones to validate system logic and responsiveness.

### Phase 5: Documentation

- Generated commissioning reports and system architecture diagrams.
- Documented non-compliant configurations and suggested remediations.
- Created an operational guide for system handover.
